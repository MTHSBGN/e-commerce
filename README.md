## Environment and dependencies

In order to run the server, a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) run time is needed with its package manager [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).
To install the dependencies, run in a shell `npm install` at the root of the project.

On windows OS some extra configuration are potentially needed concerning the port configuration etc. (we do not try to run our server on Windows plateform)

## Running the server

By default, the port 3000 is used by the server in devlopment mode. Therefore, make sure it is open on your machine.
To start the server, simply run `npm start` at the root of the project.
A link to the index page will be displayed in the shell. (http://localhost:3000)
