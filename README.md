## Set your environement

First of all, you need to install the JavaScript package manager (npm).


On the linux plateform you can type 'sudo apt install npm'.
For windows users please refer to the installation guide given there [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm)


When it is done, you need to install the express package.
On linux you just type 'npm install express --save'
For windows user it is the same procedure but more information are given here [click here](https://coderwall.com/p/mbov6w/running-nodejs-and-express-on-windows)


On windows OS some extra configuration are potentially needed concerning the port configuration etc. (we do not try to run our server on Windows plateform)

## Start the server

Before starting the server make sure that the port 3000 is available on your machine. If it is not the case, you can change the port in the ´index.js´ file.

To start the server you can type 'npm start' and the server should start.

When the server is running you can access to the index page simply by typing 'http://localhost:3000/' and the index page of the e-commerce website appears.
